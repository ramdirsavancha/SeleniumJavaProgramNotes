Arrays:-

Def:-Arrays in Java is a class which used to store group of values (elements) of same type.
Note: we can retrive elements based on there indexes.

Note :-To overcome Variables we will use Array
   In variables we will give a single value to each variable if we require 100 values we use to create 100 variables.So why Arrays came in to picture.
   
 Points:
* Arrays store same datatype elements(Homogenous datatype )(Overcome this in collections).
*Arrays are fixed length(Overcome this in collections).
*Array elements are stores in continous memory location.

Two Types of Arrays:

1.Single Dimensions Array
2.Two Dimensional Array


Advantage:

1.We can represent huge number of elements of smae type.


Disadvantages:

1.It is fixed in size.
2.Stores data of same type (homogenous)
