****STRINGS IN JAVA*******
===========================
String:--

1. In java String is a (final)class which represents a group of characters (char[]).
    *String is wrapping char[]
2.String is Immutability

-->Immutability means the value will can't re-initilaize instead of that it will create a new object.



Final Vs Immutability:
=====================
*A variable with final the value cant reinitialize
*A class with final cant inherit by its subclass.
*A method with final cant override by its subclass.


String Handlers:-
================
We Handle Strings in three ways

1.String 
2.StringBuffer--Synchronized(Only One thread can act at a time)
3.StringBuilder--(non synchronized --multiple thread can act at a time)

Diffrence between String vs StringBuffer&Builder
------------------------------------------------

*String is Immutable
String class overrides the object class equals method and StringBuffer or Buildernot overrides.
