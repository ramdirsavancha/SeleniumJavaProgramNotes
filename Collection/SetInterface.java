Set:

*Set is an sub interface of an Collectiion interface which not allows duplicate elements and which is unorder.
*Set interface has the implementation classes like HasSet,LinkedHashSet,TreeSet and sub interfaces NavigableSet and SortedSet.


HashSet:
   HashSet is an implemntation class of Set interface and it will not allows duplicates and  order of elements are not guarented.

 *HashSet is Implemented using a hash table.
*HashSet is unorder
*The add, remove, and contains methods has constant time complexity O(1). 
*Set will increase the capacity once it flls 75%



LinkedHashSet:
---------------------

LinkedHashSet is a implentation class of Set interface.

*
*All elemnts were in insertion order

TreeSet:
----------
TreeSet is a implemntation class of Set interface
*Which not allows duplicates
*By default elements are in sorted order(Ascending order)
